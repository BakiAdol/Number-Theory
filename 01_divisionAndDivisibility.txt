Divisibility Theorem :

Theorem 01 : If a|b and b|c then a|c 
       Proof : b = xa, c = yb ; here x and y some integer
               So, c = yxa
               =>  c = a(xy)
               =>  a|c
 
Theorem 02 : If d|a and d|b then d|(xa+yb) heare all are integer
       Proof : a = ed, b=fd
              So, xa+yb=xed+yfd
               => xa+yb=d(xe+fy)
               => d|(xa+yb)
    
Theorem 03 : a|b if and only if ac|bc
       Proof : b = ad
            => bc = cad
            => bc = ac(d)
    
Theorem 04 : Every positive composit integer n is a product of prime numbers.
       This is Fandamental Theorem of Arithmetic(FTA)
