-> For every composit number n, there exist number d ( d<=sqrt(n) ) and n is divisible by d.
   There can exist many d, and at least one prime d exist.
   n = 6 ; d=[2] ; 2 is prime
   n = 12 ; d=[2,3] ; 2,3 both prime
   n = 100 ; d=[2,4,5,10] ; 2,5 both prime
   n= 437 ; d=[19] ; 19 is prime
   n= 909 ; d=[3,9] ; 3 is prime

-> for any integer there can be at most one prime divisor after it's square root
