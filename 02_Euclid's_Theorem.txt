Statement : "There are infinite primely many primes"
Proof by conduction:
  Let's some list of primes p1,p2,p3,p4....pn
  Now P = p1*p2*p3*p4*...pn + 1
  n! is divided by 2 to n
  Here p1 to pn not divied P, they can divided P-1;
  So P is another prime that not present int this list p1, p2.... pn
  
Euclid's Lemma : Let a and b are integer and if p is prime then p divides ab either p divides a or p divides b
